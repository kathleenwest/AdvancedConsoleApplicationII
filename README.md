Advanced Console Application II
My Student Project: C# Programming III

Permission to publish my code submitted for the project assignment was granted by the professor. I have done my best to remove lab and school references from this project code. 

This is a very simple windows console application that I completed for a class assignment. It is shown here to illustrate my coding style, structure, and commenting. This example is considered Level 3 â€“ Advanced.

Objectives:

Generics
IDisposible Pattern
Utilities
Dynamic Array
